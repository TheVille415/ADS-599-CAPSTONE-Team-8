## 📌 Overview

This project builds an end-to-end generative AI pipeline for antiviral drug discovery. It focuses on accelerating the transition from a **known active compound (“hit”)** to a **viable candidate (“lead”)** by generating and filtering novel molecular structures.

The system uses SMILES-based molecular representations, deep learning, and rule-based filtering to propose new antiviral candidates that satisfy drug-like constraints.

This work was developed as part of the University of San Diego MS in Applied Data Science capstone.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Generate **novel antiviral molecules** using generative AI  
- Ensure outputs are **chemically valid and drug-like**  
- Provide a **decision-support tool** for early-stage drug discovery  

Rather than replacing laboratory validation, this system acts as a **computational screening layer** to prioritize candidates.

## 🧠 Key Features

- SMILES-based molecular generation  
- Baseline mutation model vs LSTM comparison  
- RDKit validation and standardization  
- Lipinski Rule of Five filtering  
- Similarity scoring against seed molecules  
- Streamlit web application for interaction  

## 🏗️ Project Pipeline

The system follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**
   - J05 antiviral compounds from ChEMBL

2. **Data Cleaning & Validation**
   - RDKit sanitization  
   - Deduplication  
   - Canonical SMILES conversion  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Molecular descriptors (MW, logP, HBD, HBA)  
   - Lipinski compliance flag  

4. **Modeling**
   - Baseline: mutation-based generator  
   - Primary: character-level LSTM  

5. **Generation**
   - Sample candidate molecules  
   - Validate with RDKit  

6. **Filtering & Ranking**
   - Lipinski rules  
   - Similarity scoring  
   - Structural constraints  

7. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit web app interface  

## 📊 Results Summary

- **Baseline Model**
  - Higher validity rate  
  - Low novelty  

- **LSTM Model**
  - Lower validity  
  - 100% novelty among valid outputs  
  - All valid outputs passed Lipinski rules  

**Key takeaway:**  
There is a tradeoff between **quantity (baseline)** and **quality + novelty (LSTM)**.
## 🌐 Web Application

🔗 **Live App:**  
https://ads-599-capstone-team-8-ga4zqwdzwasig2jxp33hgr.streamlit.app/

### What the app does:

- Accepts a SMILES string (or seed molecule)  
- Generates new molecular candidates  
- Displays:
  - Molecular structures

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Input a SMILES string or choose a seed molecule  
2. Generate candidates  
3. Review:
   - Validity  
   - Drug-likeness  
   - Structural similarity  
4. Identify promising molecules for further analysis  

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Small dataset (~87 molecules) limits generalization  
- LSTM struggles with complex molecular structures  
- Heavy reliance on Lipinski rules may exclude valid antivirals  
- Not a replacement for experimental validation  

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Expand dataset (antibiotics, cancer drugs, larger ChEMBL subsets)  
- Use transformer-based models  
- Add ADMET prediction models  
- Improve ranking and scoring system  
- Optimize generation speed in the app
